# Lab 2 (Regfile) Notes

## Instruction

*   NOT write to $0, even if an instruction should try
*   Zero Register should ALWAYS have the value 0x0
*   NOT gate the clock at any point: the clock signal should ALWAYS connect directly to the clock input of the registers without passing through ANY combinational logic
